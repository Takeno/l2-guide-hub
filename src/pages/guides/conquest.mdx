## Monthly competition

Conquest main activity is a monthly competition which begins on the first day of each month and lasts one month. During this period, players from all servers gain points to compete in individual and server ranking using both Personal Points and Server Points.

At the end of the cycle, all players with at least 1'000 personal points will get some [Bloody Coin](https://l2central.info/main/items/80306.html), some Adena, and a special 30-day rune.

All rewards can be claimed using the Conquest UI from game menu.

### How to obtain personal points

Personal points can be obtained by hunting monsters in conquest areas. The higher level is the area, the larger amount of points is obtained.\
All points are shared with party, but the character who deals the killing blow to a monster will gain 2 more points.

|Hunting zone|Level|Personal points|Server points|Area points|
|--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Daril's Water Source|112|4|4|-|
|Daril Phran's Water Source|114|6|6|-|
|Garden of Flames|120|9|9|-|
|Asa, Anima, Nox|116|18|18|19|
|Asa, Anima, Nox|120|28|28|22|

Killing special monsters is rewarded with huge amount of points and exp:

|Monster|Level|Personal points|Server points|Zone points|
|--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Seo / Craigo|112|20|20|—|
|Seo / Craigo|116|30|30|—|
|Soul Flower\*|116|180|180|95|
|Soul Flower\*|120|280|280|110|
|Soul Flower\*|124|430|430|160|
|Soul Flower\*|124|670|670|160|
|Luminous Soul\*||267|267|277|
|Soul Tree||3'326|997'920|159'667|


\* Soul Flowers and Luminous Souls are harmless monsters which drop a huge amount of XP, SP, Adena and conquest points. They have 20 HP, they spawn again after 5 min and every hit deals 1 damage.

***Hint:*** hunting Soul Flowers and Lumiinous Souls can be a good way to farm some exp and personal conquest points even without a party. A single flower in Vita zone can drop 400kk XP with vitality 900%.

After every 300 monsters killed in conquest, a reward of 250 personal points and 500 server points can be obtained from the conquest window.

#### Collecting flowers

Flowers of Fire grow only in the central part of the Fire Source, while Flowers of Life and Flowers of Power grow throughout the Fire Region. To collect flowers, talk to NPC flower and press the button inside the window.

By collecting all types of flowers, with a certain probability you can get:
- Personal conquest points
- Server conquest points
- Fire Source points
- [Seed of Fire](https://l2central.info/main/items/82616.html)
- [Ghost Soul](https://l2central.info/main/items/82611.html)
- [Sacred Fire Summon Scroll](https://l2central.info/main/items/82614.html)
- [Eigis Armor Fragment](https://l2central.info/main/items/82083.html)


After every 160 flowers collected, a reward of 648 personal points and 214 server points can be obtained from the conquest window.

*TODO: explaination about PvP in conquest.*

## Sacred Fire

The Sacred Fire is mini-game to obtain Divine Fire, server conquest points and [Soul-imbued Flower](https://l2central.info/main/items/82660.html).

First of all, a [Sacred Fire Summon Scroll](https://l2central.info/main/items/82614.html) is needed to summon the Sacred Fire. This item can be bought in conquest shop for 1500x Personal Conquest Points, 2x Seed of Fire and 1x Ghost Totem. Seeds of Fire are obtained by enhancing [Life Source](#fire-source); Ghost Totem is obtained by enhancing [Fire Totem](#fire-totem).

The Sacred Fire can be summoned in the Fire Source's common area while character is transformed in a rabbit. Using the item, a [Sacred Fire](https://l2central.info/main/npcs/34662.html) spawns near the character. Up to 3 Sacred Fire can be lit at the same time. If the Sacred Fire is not extinguished within 25 minutes, the following reward is guaranteed:
- 1x Divine Fire
- 1x Soul-imbued Flower
- 2x Seed of Fire
- Conquest Server points
- [Fire Source](#fire-source) points

The status of the Sacred Fire summoned can be found clicking on the flame icon in top-left corner of Conquest Abilities window.

## Conquest Abilities

Starting from level 110+, anyone can access a new power given by conquest abilities. They are 5 passive abilities that must be enhanced from level 0 to level 10.

All abilities start from level 0 and have a mastery score which can be increased in different ways. Once the mastery score is 100%, the ability can be enhanced to the next level paying an amount of [Fire Orb](https://l2central.info/main/items/82617.html) based on the level. Fire Orb can be found in Conquest shop.

***Hint:*** although to enhance the ability to the next level Fire Orbs/Conquest points are needed, abilities like Life Source and Fire Totem can be upgraded up to 100% even before lv. 110.

|Ability Level|Fire Orbs required|
|:--:|:--:|
|Lv. 1|300|
|Lv. 2|700|
|Lv. 3|1000|
|Lv. 4|2000|
|Lv. 5|2000|
|Lv. 6|2000|
|Lv. 7|3500|
|Lv. 8|3500|
|Lv. 9|3500|

### Fire Source
This passive ability gives Weapon P./M. Atk and Attribute Attack/Resistance based on its level.

Fire Source points, which are needed to enhance the ability, can be obtained in the central area of the Fire Source. After entering the zone, the character's HP will begin to decrease and when HP drops to zero, dead character will be moved outside the zone and no experience will be lost. Fire Source points will be added every 5 minutes alive in the zone.

**Strategy:** although in the Fire Source's central area there are some healers, using [Tanzanite skill](/references/jewels#tanzanite) is a common trick to survive to HP drain. Create a macro with the skill and put the macro in loop. The HP recovered by the skill should keep the character alive.

Another way to get Fire Source points is getting Sealed Source of Fire upgrading [Battle Soul](#battle-soul) ability. Keeping alive a [Sacred Fire](#sacred-fire) for 25 minutes provides some Fire Source points.
