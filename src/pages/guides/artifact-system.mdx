# Artifact System
The Artifact System is a feature that allows characters Lv. 100+ to enhance their battle capabilities. This system introduces various artifacts, each inscribed with an ancient rune, which when equipped, provide significant boosts to a character's stats. The artifacts are categorized into four types: Attack, Defence, Support, and Balance, each offering unique stat enhancements.

To equip artifacts, you need Artifact Book.

## Artifacts

There are 4 types of artifacts:

1. **[Balance Artifacts (brown)](/references/artifacts#balance-brown):** Offer a range of benefits, including boosts to both physical and magical attack, defense, critical rates, speed, and resistance to certain damage types. Balance artifacts can be slotted into four set slots, with a total of twelve slots available.

2. **[Attack Artifacts (red)](/references/artifacts#attack-red):** Focus on increasing offensive capabilities such as physical and magical attack, attack speed, and critical damage. These are more potent when empowered compared to balance artifacts. Each set can have one attack artifact, with three slots available in total.

3. **[Defense Artifacts (blue)](/references/artifacts#defense-blue):** These artifacts enhance defensive stats like physical and magical defense, HP, MP, and resistances to various weapon types. Like attack artifacts, defense ones provide greater benefits upon empowerment. Each set can include one defense artifact, with three available slots.

4. **[Support Artifacts (brown)](/references/artifacts#support-brown):** These are geared towards enhancing experience gain, HP drain, speed, healing received, and reducing vitality consumption and skill MP usage. Support artifacts, when empowered, offer more significant boosts than balance artifacts. Each set can have one support artifact.


**Note:** Artifacts with the same name can't be equipped. *Artifact - P. Atk Attack*  and *Artifact - P.Atk Balance* are two different artifacts.

In addition, there are 8 non-upgradable powerful [yellow balance artifacts](/references/artifacts#balance-yellow) and 4 non-upgradable time-limited [PA balance Artifacts](/references/artifacts#balance-pa-brown).

### Artifact upgrade

To enhance the power of your artifacts in Lineage 2, it's essential to understand the basics of the upgrade system. Initially, artifacts come without individual effects; they only contribute to the collective set effect once a complete set is assembled. The real strength of an artifact is unlocked when it is upgraded to +1 or higher, which activates its unique bonuses.

To upgrade an artifact, you need to collect three artifacts that share the same type, indicated by their color. The name of the artifacts does not need to match, just the color category they belong to. To upgrade +5 and higher artifacts, the materials must be upgraded too as specified in this table:

|Upgrade|Chance|Materials|
|---|---|---|
|+0 → +1 | 100% | 3x Artifact +0 same type |
|+1 → +2 | 70% | 3x Artifact +0 same type |
|+2 → +3 | 70% | 3x Artifact +0 same type |
|+3 → +4 | 50% | 3x Artifact +0 same type |
|+4 → +5 | 40% | 3x Artifact +1 same type |
|+5 → +6 | 40% | 3x Artifact +1 same type |
|+6 → +7 | 40% | 3x Artifact +1 same type |
|+7 → +8 | 30% | 3x Artifact +3 same type |
|+8 → +9 | *missing*|3x Artifact +3 same type|
|+9 → +10| *missing*|3x Artifact +3 same type|
