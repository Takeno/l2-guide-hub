# Homunculus

Homunculi are special creatures that provide passive bonuses to the character. A character can enstablish bonds with only one homunculus per time and this can be done any time through the homunculus interface - the button with heart icon. The homunculus with bonds established is identified by a heart in the top-right corner.

A character starts with 3 slots where host homunculus. Additional slots can be unlocked paying adena and jewels.

Homunculus can grow from Level 1 to Level 5. Each level gives a different passive effect based on how strong that level's bond is, between 1 and 3.
In summary, new homunculus' levels give additional effects and those effects must be maximized by bonds.

Concluding, there are 10 different homunculi each of which has 3 different rarities: common, high-grade (green), top-grade (red).

## How to create an Homunculus

There are two ways to create a new homunculus: Cradle of Life and Cradle of Time.

### Creation using Cradle of Life

The creation process with Cradle of Life starts by pressing the *Create* button and by paying 1'000'000 Adena. To complete the process, all the 4 bars must be fulfilled:
- Blood bar: pressing the + icon, 10'000 HP are drained
- Soul bar: pressing the + icon, 500'000 SP are consumed
- Tears bar: pressing the + icon, 1 vitality slot is consumed
- Waiting time: this bar is automatically fulfilled after 24h from the start, even when offline

[See here](references/homunculus#probabilities-with-cradle-of-life-or-common-homunculus-hourglass) the probabilities for homunculi created by Cradle of Life.


### Creation using Cradle of Time

To use the Cradle of Time, [Common Homunculus' Hourglass](https://l2central.info/main/items/81815.html) or [Homunculus' Shiny Hourglass](https://l2central.info/main/items/82904.html) are needed with the addition of 2'000'000 adena, and a new homunculus is instantly created.

*Common Homunculus' Hourglass* can be obtained from clan quests when dual class get a new level, and can be bought via Einhasad's Store for 1800 PA Points (1 per day) or for 15'000'000 Adena (up to 3 per day). [See here](references/homunculus#probabilities-with-cradle-of-life-or-common-homunculus-hourglass) the probabilities for homunculi created by Common Homunculus' Hourglass.

*Homunculus' Shiny Hourglass* can be bought via Einhasad's Store for 240 Einhasad's Golde Coin (up to 3 per day). [See here](/references/homunculus#probabilities-with-homunculus-shiny-hourglass) the probabilities for homunculi created by Common Homunculus' Hourglass.


## Upgrade points

*Upgrade points* are needed to increment homunculus' level and upgrade its skills. New *upgrade points* can be obtained in two methods:
1. one point every 500 monsters killed by the character or one member of the party;
1. offering 2 vitality slots.

Both methods can be used 5 times per day, and the counter can be reset up to 3 times using 5 [Powerful Fish](https://l2central.info/main/items/47552.html).

***Calc zone:*** with 15 Powerful Fish per day and 10'000 mobs killed, 20 *upgrade points* can be collected each day.

***Tip:*** Vitality is very important to improve exp gain, but [Vitality Sustaining Rune](https://l2central.info/main/search/?s=Vitality+Sustaining+Rune) and Chuchu's passive is a nice way to replenish the vitality slots and use them for free to get more upgrade points.


## Upgrade homunculus' level

Under Homunculus Stats > Enchantment, the EXP bar can be filled using *upgrade points* and the automatically increase when 100% is reached.

Each level gives an additional bond's skill which has 3 levels of strength.

|Level|Upgrade points needed|
|:--:|:--:|
|1|0|
|2|60|
|3|90|
|4|180|
|5|270|
|0 â†’ 5|600|


## Upgrade bond's skills

Under Homunculus Stats > Enchantment the unlocked bond's skills are shown. Each skill can be upgraded from 0 to 3.

The upgrade mechanism is based on a random number generator and each attempt costs 1 upgrade points and 100'000 SP.

3 numbers are randomly generated (System, Character, Homunculus) and the bond's level is based on the result:

- **Level 1:** if neither the character nor the Homunculus guess the number guessed by the system;
- **Level 2:** if either the character or the Homunculus guess the number guessed by the system (33%);
- **Level 3:** if both the character and the Homunculus guess the number guessed by the system (2.7%).

There is no way to influence the result, so the text above can be ignored and just spend upgrade points until the level 3 is reached.
