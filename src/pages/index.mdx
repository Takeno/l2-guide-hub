Hi! Welcome to L2 Duckpedia, an hub of guides and references for [Lineage 2 Europe version](https://eu.4game.com/lineage2/).

Here I share all the knowledge accumulated during my experience on the game. I hope these notes and references can help new people to understand this complex game.

This is not a wikipedia about ducks, but the name has been invented by my clan mates based on [my character](#who-am-i).


## Who I am

I am DuckSlayer, one of the noobest player in Core server. I have no hate against ducks, but ducks were the only monsters I could kill when I started playing L2.
